# Java FullStack Developer Specialization

Introducing the Java FullStack Developer Specialization, designed to empower your software development career by providing a comprehensive skillset for building integrated, cloud-ready web applications.

The specialization consists of three intensive courses:

1. **Fundamentals of Java Programming**: 
* Understanding of core Java programming concepts and principles
* Proficiency in object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction
* Gaining knowledge in advanced Java topics like multi-threading, concurrency, and the application of common data structures

2. **Front-End for Java Full Stack Development**: 
* Acquiring essential skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating interactive web pages
* Mastery of the Angular framework, including the development of reactive forms and handling of HTTP requests
* Building and deploying complex web applications that integrate with APIs

3. **Data Structures & Back-End with Java**: 
* Knowledge of fundamental data structures and algorithms and their implementation in Java
* Proficiency in server-side programming with Servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSP)
* Experience in connecting to databases using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and working with industry-standard frameworks like Spring and Hibernate

By the end of this specialization, you'll be well-versed in Java programming, dynamic front-end web development using Angular, and robust back-end system creation using Spring and Spring Boot.
