# Data Structure & Backend with Java

This comprehensive course delves deep into the nuances of data structures and backend development with Java. The curriculum is strategically designed across three core modules, seamlessly bridging the understanding of theory with practical application.

1. In the first module, we delve into Java-based data structures, focusing on arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, the String class, and the Java Collections Framework. You'll gain a foundational understanding of efficient data storage and manipulation in backend development.

2. Transitioning into the second module, we introduce you to Spring and Spring Boot, the pillars of Java application development. We focus on the creation of basic Spring applications, Spring MVC-based web applications, and the overall architecture of Spring Boot.

3. In the third module, we tackle RESTful web services using Spring Boot, guiding you through the creation of these services, the implementation of CRUD operations for resources, and the application of Spring Security for securing these services.

By the end of this course, participants will be capable of designing and implementing effective data structures and crafting backend solutions using Java. This will set the path toward a promising career in software development.
